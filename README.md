This respository includes data of 40 model scenarios used in the manuscript "Decomposing the intra-annual variability of flushing characteristics in a tidal bay 1 along the North Sea". Due to the file size limit, we have splitted data each scenario into several sub-files, which should be merged upon usage. Each file name is named "scenario name"+".7z."+"subfile number". For example, "F10.7z.011" means the 11th file of the scenario F10. The scenario names and other details could be found in Table 1 of the manuscript.

The master branch contains scenarios F1, F4, F7, F10, FG1, FG4, FG7, FG10, and G1. Other scenarios are placed in 31 branches named after the scenario names.
